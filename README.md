const nextSession = new Date('2024-01-15T19:00:00'); // Update this with your actual session time
```

### Adding NPCs
In `script.js`, find the `npcsData` array and add new NPCs:
```javascript
{
    id: 5,
    name: "Your NPC Name",
    description: "Description of the NPC",
    image: "URL to NPC image",
    role: "NPC Role",
    location: "Where they can be found"
}
```

### Adding Party Members
In `script.js`, find the `partyData` array and add new characters:
```javascript
{
    id: 5,
    playerName: "Player Name",
    characterName: "Character Name",
    class: "Character Class",
    level: 5,
    portrait: "URL to character portrait",
    spells: ["Spell 1", "Spell 2", "Spell 3"],
    magicalItems: ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
}
```

```javascript

    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"] // Use existing tags: movement, combat, spell, conditions, saving-throws, spellcasting
}
```

```html
<iframe src="YOUR_MAP_URL" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" title="Your Map"></iframe>
